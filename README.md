# Conway's Game of Life 

Game of Life coursework for the module Research Computing with C++.

# Compile

Pre-requisites: this program requires g++ with OpenMP support. Therefore, it assumes that there is a
                binary of g++ with OpenMP support in /usr/local/bin/g++ ready to be used by this
					 project.

MAC OS X: find more information on how to comply with the pre-requisite in extras/gcc-4.9-bin/README.md

Execute the following commands in the main directory of the project:

```
$ ./compile.sh
```

The compile process has been tested in: 

	- Mac OS X 10.9.5

# Run Unit Tests (optional)

Execute the following commands in the main directory of the project in order to check the
correctness of the code.

```
$ build/test/GameOfLifeTest
```

# Run the Program 

After the program and the tests have been compiled, execute this command to run the program:

```
$ build/src/GameOfLife --input test/input.txt --output output.txt
$ build/src/GameOfLife --random 100 --output output.txt
```

# Coursework Instructions

1. Research Conwayâ€™s Game of Life (the Boolean version of the floating-point game
presented in the lectures) and understand the algorithm. Explain the algorithm in your own
words in your report. 
[5 marks]

2. Create an appropriate scaffold for your project, by adapting that of the previous coursework
assignment, with CMakeLists.txt files, and an appropriate layout for source code and tests,
and a main executable. 
[5 marks]

3. Create an appropriate serial implementation in C++, with an output file describing the state
of the simulation over time. Define an input file specifying the domain size and initial state.
[20 marks]

4. While doing (2) above, create appropriate unit tests as you go, using the Catch framework. 
[15 marks]

5. While doing (2) above, create sensible commit messages in GitHub, and continually
commit to version control.
[10 marks]

6. Use a high-level language of your choice to turn your output file into a video. (E.g. Python
or MATLAB). Upload a created video to the internet (e.g. via You Tube) and put the link in
your report.
[5 marks]

7. Parallelise your code using EITHER OpenMP or MPI. 
[20 marks]

8. Modify your output file and video-creator to work with your parallel code. 
[15 marks]

9. Execute your code in parallel on a computer with at least 4 compute cores, and plot an
appropriate graph showing achieved speedup. Comment on your results. 
[5 marks]
